                    Everything, Everywhere, All at once is a sci-fi, action, and comedy movie about Evelyn Quan Wang. Evelyn is a middle-aged woman who finds out she is the chosen one to save every multiverse from an all-powerful being. While she struggles with multiple issues that first generation immigrants experience, like: financial issues, language gaps, and strained familial relationships, Evelyn learns to access the skills and lives of her alternate universe selves to complete her mission.

                    Aside from the sci-fi elements that are seen throughout the movie, it also showcases how we can overcome our own challenges through acceptance, love, and unitedness. At the latter portions of the film, it unravels to become more of a story that deals with how some Asian traditions still linger with time (such as, conservative beliefs that still remain rampant till this day).
